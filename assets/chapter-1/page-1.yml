  Nimona walks around a lab filled with chemicals, machinery, and ... which she taps.
  Ballister appears in the doorframe, shouting "What! Who are you? How did you get in here?"
  Nimona answers "Hey Boss! The name's Nimona", shaking his hand with an audible clank.
  She looks down at what appears to be a mechanical hand, shaking it more. "Huh. Oh. Nice arm."
  Nimona puts her arms on her side. "The agency sent me. I'm your new sidekick."
  He looks down at her, saying "Why would they send some KID to be my sidekick?"
  "I don't know. Something about helping your image?" Nimona crosses her arms. "They want you to appeal to today's youth."
  Ballister, unphased, replies "Did the agency really send you"
  Nimona closes her eyes and smiles. "Yes"
  "Where's the letter?" he asks before putting his arms on his side.
  Assuming a thinking pose, Nimona replies "I left it in the. Uh"
  She throws her arms up. "Fiiine maybe the agency didn't send me"
  Ballister throws up his arm too. "I knew it"
