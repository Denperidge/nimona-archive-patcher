  Ballister leans away from a starstruck Nimona. She pleads "but I'm a huge fan of your work"
  She throws her arms up in the air. "You've balister Blackhear,t the biggest name in supervillainy!".
  Images of a giant robot and dragon burning down a city flash behind her.
  Nimona hangs on Ballisters shoulder with an evil smug face. "You're an inspiration!"
  "Yes well, I don't need a sidekick" Ballister responds by lifting Nimona up by the back of her shirt. 
  "Oh come on! EVERYONE has a sidekick these days" Nimona says, throwing her arms forward in frustration.
  "I can't have some kid following me around all day". Ballister walks away from her moping.
  She responds "I'm not a kid"
  "I'm a shark", a newly transformed-into-a-shark Nimona continues at a newly "aaahh" screaming Ballister.
  Her fangs form a smile of pride.
  The bipedal shark continues. "Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm a shapeshifter"
  Ballister crosses his arms. "Yes you might have mentioned that"
  He holds his hand on his beard. "Well, I suppose I can see how that would be useful". Nimona smiles.
  "Fine, you're hired. Welcome aboard." He shakes Nimona's fin, who throws her head back. "Yessssss"
