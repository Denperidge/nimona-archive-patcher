Nimona: |-
  The girl who is apparently a shark and/or a shapeshifter.
  Except for her bangs and streaks of hair in front of her ear, her entire head is shaved.
Ballister: |-
  The accomplished villain.
  His cape, slicked back black hair and goatee have not yet stopped him from looking real evil.
Goldenloin: |-
  A prince charming of a man.
  The only thing that would have distracted you from the caped, fancy, bright, layered and shoulderpadded armor,
  would have been his long blonde hair covering that went below his shoulders.
